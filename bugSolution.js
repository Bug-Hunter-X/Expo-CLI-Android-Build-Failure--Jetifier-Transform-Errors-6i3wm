Solutions to this problem often involve resolving dependency conflicts.  Here are a few strategies:

1. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** carefully review your `package.json` file, looking for any libraries that might have known issues or conflicts.  Search for similar issues reported in the library's issue tracker.

2. **Update dependencies:** ensure you're using the latest versions of all libraries. Sometimes, newer versions address compatibility issues resolved by their maintainers.

3. **Remove unnecessary libraries:** try removing unused libraries as they may be the source of the conflict.

4. **Clean and rebuild:** sometimes a simple clean and rebuild of the project can resolve temporary issues.  Run `expo prebuild` then `expo run:android`.

5. **Use `expo prebuild --clean`:** This command thoroughly cleans your build environment before rebuilding the project, which could eliminate temporary files causing problems.  Then run `expo run:android`.

6. **Examine jetifier log:** The error message might point to a specific library causing problems.  Focus your attention on that library. Often this information is directly reported by the failed command.

7. **Check AndroidX support:** Make sure that all libraries used in your project support AndroidX.  This is a major requirement for modern Android development.

**Example of updated `package.json` (Illustrative):**

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "expo": ">=48.0.0",
    "react-native": "~0.71.8",
    // ... other dependencies, ensuring that updates are performed to the latest versions that support AndroidX
    "some-problem-library": "^2.0.0" //Update if needed
  }
}
```

If none of these steps work, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to aid debugging.
