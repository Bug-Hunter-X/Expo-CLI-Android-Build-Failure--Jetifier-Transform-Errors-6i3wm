# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transform Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI: failures during the `jetifier` transform.  The `jetifier` tool is used to convert Android libraries to be compatible with the AndroidX library set.

## Problem

The Android build process fails with errors related to the `jetifier` transform.  These errors usually stem from conflicts or incompatibilities between libraries in your project.

## Solution

This repository provides a solution involving dependency analysis and potential fixes to resolve the conflicts.

The `bug.js` file shows example code that might lead to this error (although the actual problem might reside in a third-party library or a custom native module). The `bugSolution.js` file proposes solutions.
